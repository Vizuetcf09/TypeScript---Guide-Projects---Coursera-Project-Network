# What and Why  TypeScript?

## What is TypeScript?

- TypeScript (TS) is an open source object-oriented language developed and mantained by Microsoft.

- TS supports all JS libraries.
- TS is statically typed programming language, so itÂ´s more predictable and easy to debug and it scale to build complex applications.
- TS provides compile-time error-checking.
- Since it support types system, wich increase the code quality, readability and makes it easy to maintain.
- Cross-platform.
- Object-Oriented Language.
- Static type-checking.
- Optional static typing.

# Identifiers - names

An identifiers is a name we use to identify things like variables, functions, etc. There rules and conventions when it comes to identifiers.

- A name canot start with a numerical values, but may contain numbers inside it.
- A name may starts with uppercase letter (A-Z), lowecase letters (a-z) and inderscores.
- A name should not contain special characters like %, #, $, etc.

/* this is multiple
	line comments
	expample 1, example 2 */
