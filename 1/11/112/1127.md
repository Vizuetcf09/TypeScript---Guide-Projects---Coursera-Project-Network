# Data Types

## Special data types

**Table 1.1.2.6.1**. Special Data Types.

| Data Types | Description                                                                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Void       | `void` implies no data. This is typically used when you are defining functions.        |
| Undefined  | Absence of the variable itself.                                                        |
| Null       | Absence of a value for variable.                                                       |
| Never      | When you are sure that something is never goin to hapen. Ex: infinite loop never stop. |
| Any        | `any` signifies any type of data.                                                      |
|            |                                                                                        |
